   <h1>Get in contact with clubs in your area</h1>
   <p>To get in contact with a club in your area is simple, to know if they have a group for your level you go on the clubs website and look on groups. Usally you need a bat and a pair of shoes to get started but they maybe borrow you one, or you can perhaps buy one from them. If you are a beginner look if they are playing any lower league division or just see if there is a possibility to tournaments for them. Why you should do this is for the reason that you might one day enjoy to try out your strenght. </p>
